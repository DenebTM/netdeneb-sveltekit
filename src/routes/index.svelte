        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <p>
            I'm Deneb, a maned wolf and hobbyist developer from ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹&nbsp;Austria,
            currently studying comp-sci in Innsbruck.
        </p><p>
            This is mostly a place for me to put my personal pet projects, but
            you'll also find my ref and other art I've received here. Still under
            construction, so check back later for more!
